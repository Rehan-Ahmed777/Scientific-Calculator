 Breif Description:
 The calculator can do basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also
 supports square roots, square, cube, x raised to y, factorial, percentage, and more.
 I used a blue-violet background color to make the calculator look nice and and aesthetically pleasing to
 look. All buttons are clearly labeled, and I also added a label at the top that says 'Scientific Calculator'. The
 layout of buttons is made user-friendly, and I have also grouped the buttons of same category like all
 numbers together etc.
 All the math operations are handled using built-in C# Math functions like Math.Sin, Math.Cos, Math.Sqrt
 etc.
 I tried to manage error cases like divide by zero or invalid input. If the input is not proper, the calculator
 wonâ€™t crash but instead will safely handle it.<img width="959" alt="Scientific Calculator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87d26aca-c09a-4fd8-8a0c-bbe5d18a89ff" />
